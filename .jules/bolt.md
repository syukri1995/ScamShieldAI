## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Keyword Frequency Extraction with SQLite json_each
**Learning:** Extracting and parsing JSON stored in text columns on the Python side (using `json.loads` in a loop) is extremely inefficient compared to using SQLite's native JSON extension, especially when paginating or limiting rows.
**Action:** Use SQLite's `json_each` to flatten and aggregate JSON arrays directly in the database query. This drastically reduces the overhead of serialization/deserialization and avoids sending unneeded data over the connection.

## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Pickled ML Model Loading with memory caching
**Learning:** Pickling a scikit-learn model and loading it from disk via `joblib.load` at every request is highly inefficient and creates an IO bottleneck taking ~1.5s per prediction.
**Action:** Use global variables to cache model and vectorizer loading into memory instead of reloading them on every call. Avoid `functools.lru_cache` since it would cache `(None, None)` if called before the model is fully trained, making it impossible to refresh the cache without restarting the server.

## 2024-05-18 - Optimize Regex Compilation in Text Analysis Rules
**Learning:** Recompiling regex patterns (via `re.search` or `re.findall`) inline inside a function that is called repeatedly in text analysis loops causes significant and unnecessary dictionary lookup and compilation overhead.
**Action:** Pre-compile regex patterns at the module level using `re.compile` and reuse these compiled pattern objects in analysis functions (`pattern.search` or `pattern.findall`) to avoid recompilation overhead on every function call.
